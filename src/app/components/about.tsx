    'Is this site affiliated with Apple, iOS, or caniuse.com?',

  [
    'What is your source data?',
    'This site uses data from [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) ([caniuse github](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/tree/main)), an open-source project to collect and present data on web browser compatibility.',
  ],
  [
    'How do you determine if something is not supported?',
    'If Android Chrome supports a feature more than iOS WebKit, that feature is consider missing with special note if "Partially supported".',
  ],
  [
    'Why is this iOS specific? Why not Android?',
    'iOS WebKit engine is a monopoly on iPhones and iPads. On the other hand, Android allows browser and engine competition. NOTE: EU residents might have other engine options in the future due to DMA.',

  [
    'Why did you make this site?',
    "I have spent a lot of time testing websites + PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) on iPhones and iPads. I have lost a lot of my life to it - and I'll never ever get that time back. I wanted a place where I could see all the missing features at once and others could as well.",
