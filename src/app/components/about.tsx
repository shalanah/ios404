    'Is this site affiliated with Apple, iOS, or caniuse.com?',
    'No. Absolutely not. Nada. Zilch. Zero. Nein. iOS404 is a pet project and not affiliated with any of those entities.',
  ],
  [
    'What is your source data?',
    'This site uses data from caniuse.com, which is an open-source project to collect and present data on web browser compatibility.',
  ],
  [
    'How do you determine if something is not supported?',
    'Android Chrome features are compared to iOS WebKit features. If Android Chrome supports a feature more than iOS WebKit, we consider that iOS feature lacking or missing.',
  ],
  [
    'Why is this iOS specific? Why not Android?',
    'iOS WebKit is a monopoly engine on iPhones and iPads*. This means Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox or any other browser on an iPhone or iPad is still just WebKit. On the other hand, Android allows browser and engine competition. *EU residents may have other options in future due to DMCA.',
  ],
  [
    'Why did you make this site?',
    "I have spent way too much time learning about what iOS does not support by testing websites + PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) on iPhones and iPads. I have lost a lot of my life to it - and I'll never ever get that time back. I wanted a place where I could see all the missing features in one place and others could as well.",

  [
    'Who are you?',
    "Hi! ðŸ‘‹ So nice to meet you, and kind of you to ask! I'm Shalanah Dawson a frontend developer. I started making websites in 2000 to showcase my high school art and photography projects. I love coding, design, animation/interaction, and math. You can find me on LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter.",
